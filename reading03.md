### CVCS - Centralized Version Control System, this system will allow programmers to have more knowledge of co-workers process with certain files and give administrators more control of handing out the privileges
### DVCS - Distributed Version Control systems, confronts major vulnerability of the Central Version System, if the CVS goes down co-workers cant change or modify anything on that file. also if the file hasnt been backed up then all files will be lost.
### What is Git? is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project this is called Commit Git creates a snapshots of files and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the stored identical version of it. anything adjusted on git for example a file or directory change will always be tracked. Developers of the project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005 many developers stopped using this DVCS due to problems between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status.
### ACP Add, Commit, Push are the three main parts of beable to draw files from a global site like Github and being able to bring the files to your personal computer to be able to modify and create your site/ files in your own way.
