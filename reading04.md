### we have a reading about Wireframing which is a nice way to be able to sketch out a detailed layout or guideline to create a nice login or website. Three key principles I read about was 1.Clarity 2.Confidence and 3. Simplicity is key, being clear about what you want presented is very important to a good outlook and picture of what you want created. Having confidence in what your imaging and what you want created will help you soar to success, without confidence you will always be wondering what is right or wrong. You are the creator so you make it how you want it and can always make adjustments if needed. Having simplicity makes things easy to undergo and understand, the last thing you should do is add to much and make things overwhelming or confusing for others visiting your site.
