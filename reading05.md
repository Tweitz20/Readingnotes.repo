# CSS Info

### CSS is  way to build the presentation of websites for the viewers to see, for exmple adding back ground color or boarders buttons and adding pictures to your content. In VSC there is a process to being able to add css to your html, you have to make a html file before you can make a css file to be able to modify the look of your html. learning css was a little tough to wrap around but once you get some things down it start to feel more of a flow.

### CSS is a rule-based language that you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. once you have the html built how you want it you just type what section you want to customize and add {} around the content you are wanting to add to the html file. i was working on mine and missed one bracket and a colon and was wondering what was wrong, thats the thing about code if you miss little sign or symbol nothing works.
