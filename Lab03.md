#### Lab 03 submission
## What is Git? is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project this is called Commit Git creates a snapshots of files and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the stored identical version of it. anything adjusted on git for example a file or directory change will always be tracked. Developers of the project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005 many developers stopped using this DVCS due to problems between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeepers.
