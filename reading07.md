#### this section is about the control flow and javascript functions. the control flow is the way you tell a certain program or website for example to preform the way you want it too. the thing about control flow is you need to make sure every detail you want to happen within your program or website is list specifically because if you miss out a detail your program will only do what you tell it to do. so it seems easy but being less specific can cause problems so be very on point and detailed with what you want it to do. using if and else are commands that nwill make sure what you are saying is executed properly in the way you want it to.

#### Functions in a short description is a block of code designed to perform a particular task or command you want the website to do. function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, and are the same rules as variables. to define a java function is with a function keyword, followed by a name, and followed with (). the function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. Arguments and values are recieved by the function when it is invoked and the arguments and values will perform like variables. functions can also comute a return value and that means it is returned back to the caller. something else important it variables declared within a javascript function, become local to that function and the variables can only be accessed with that particular function.
